  <h1 align="center"> Hi, I am Karen </h1>
  <h3 align="center"> Welcome to my profile. 
        I am a master economics focus on research activities related to poverty, development, and public policy. I am interested not only in apply economic theories and methodologies to improve peopleâ€™s wellbeing, but also research considering a interdisciplinary approach since I consider that some academics at the moment to study economical facts, forget that they are studying the decision-making of social individuals, who do not always act rationally or following specific purposes.
